🚀 About Me


As a Software Engineering student, I combine technical education with hands-on experience from energy, industrial, and customer service sectors. I thrive in high-pressure situations where attention to detail matters, and I apply this mindset to building reliable software solutions.

I'm looking for an internship or junior role where I can learn quickly and contribute from day one. 
I'm flexible about the specific role - whether it's web development, DevOps, data analysis, or IT support, I'm ready to dive in and master whatever tools and technologies are needed.
