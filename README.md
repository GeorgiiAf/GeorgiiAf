🚀 About Me


As a Software Engineering student, I combine technical education with hands-on experience from energy, industrial, and customer service sectors. I thrive in high-pressure situations where attention to detail matters, and I apply this mindset to building reliable software solutions.

I'm looking for an internship or junior role where I can learn quickly and contribute from day one. 
I'm flexible about the specific role - whether it's web development, DevOps, data analysis, or IT support, I'm ready to dive in and master whatever tools and technologies are needed.


🎯 **Currently hunting for:** Internships | Junior Roles | Apprenticeships 
🔥 **Ready for:** DevOps, Web Dev, IT Support, Data Analysis, Backend, Cloud, Networks  
🌱 **Currently learning:** Jenkins, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Azure Cloud Services, Data Visualization  
💡 **Strengths:** Problem Solving, Team Collaboration, Mathematical Aptitude, Client Service
💪 **My superpower:** Learning anything fast under pressure (yes)
